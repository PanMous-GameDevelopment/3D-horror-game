# 3D-horror-game
3D horror game made with C# and Unity.
The game was created as part of my thesis and was rated 10/10.

1. Open the "Glycon" folder with Unity.
2. In the "Scenes" folder first open the "MainMenu" scene.
3. Start the application.

The game contains AI state machine, procedural animation, inventory system made with scriptable objects, usable items, player controller with stats, graphic shaders, UI elements, scene transitions with animation, PBR textures, particles and more.

The game uses the Deferred rendering path and is optimized with occlusion culling, static batching on the static objects and proper 3D modeling. I could also use light baking but it wasnt necessary and it would take alot of space in the folder.

Controls: Shift to run, Right click for camera zoom, Left click to interact, F to light the matches and E to use the bandages.
